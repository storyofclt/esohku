                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>What will be the new normal post-COVID-19? Many of us may wonder. Unemployment, wage cuts, layoffs might be some negative thoughts that pop up off the top of your head if you are a fresh graduate looking for a job this year.
                  However, the future is not all doom and gloom. This international crisis is also bringing new job opportunities to certain sectors and positive changes in work environments. It also unveils a chance for these young minds to rethink
                  and reorganize their career and life plans.</p>

                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Job market trends</b></p>
                <p>From a survey done by KPMG in 2020 in view of the HK post coronavirus pandemic job market, the major sectors that seek to expand rapidly compared to 2019 is “innovation and technology”. From the data shown, only 44% of the firms in
                  2019 seeked to increase headcount in 2019 while there are 52% of the firms looking to increase headcount in 2020. Meanwhile, in 2019 there were only 18% of managers in consumer markets looking to reduce their headcount, in 2020 a
                  major reduction in the manager confidence could be seen as 41% of the firms are expecting to reduce their headcount. In the analysis of the survey, they have mentioned that “the higher headcount demand for innovation and technology
                  is likely due to the growing reliance and openness of consumers across the Great Bay Area to use digital tools”. Thus, a switch of talent and focus could potentially be seen for fresh graduates looking for jobs during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>From another source by “The Randstad Hong Kong’s Employer Pulse Survey”, the coronavirus pandemic didn’t seem to have a drastic impact on the employment strategy of Hong Kong firms. In the survey, it showed that 63% of respondents
                  are still hiring or planning to hire. Which shows the potential for growth in the job market, in contrast with the common fear of a total stagnation in the job market during the pandemic due to the slow down in the economy. However,
                  the coronavirus does bring some tremendous changes in the work environment such as a switch to work from home, that fresh graduates will have to be able to quickly prepare for and adapt to.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>New opportunities arising</b></p>
                <p>Under the current pandemic, many activities are forced to move online to aid social distancing policies and avoid infection. One of them is learning. Many schools are required to conduct online classes, communication platforms such as Zoom are on the rise. Online education is also gaining popularity among students and parents as a way to facilitate learning at school and consolidate knowledge when face to face teaching is restricted. This pandemic also brought many to rethink the resource distribution in the public healthcare system and what we can do to better prepare if another pandemic should appear in the future.</p>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Government’s action </b></p>
                <p>The Adecco Group has recently done research on how different governments around the world have reacted to the pandemic, aiming to discover what policies are most helpful to minimise the disruption caused. The conclusion is simple, it is important for governments to act quick. The study found out that for every week without economic activity, the negative economic impacts brought by COVID-19 are exponentially increased. This means that the government should aim to provide timely support to corporates to secure employment and stimulate  economic activity at the same time. They must also ensure that the financial aids issued are received by the people in need as soon as possible. </p>

                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>The Way Forward: How to Cope Up With These Trends?</b></p>
                <p>Regardless of the economic impact of COVID-19, it is important to build career resilience, thus preparing yourself for any disruptions in the job market. A recent article by Forbes has highlighted some ways you can utilise this time to prepare yourself for the post-coronavirus job market. Here are the two most important tips.</p>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Strengthen Your Skillset</b></p>
                <p>The current situation, more than ever, has highlighted the importance of building your skillset. Considering the constant changes in industries and the job market, it is very important to be adaptable to changes in order to be successful in your future career endeavours. This can be done by developing and honing your skills. You can never have ‘enough’ skills for any role - introspect not only your technical skills but also your soft skills like communication, leadership and problem solving. Ask yourself - where can I improve? Once you have identified your shortcomings, develop a plan to strategically improve in those areas. There’s a treasure trove of resources available online and most of them are low cost or even free for students, like Udemy, Khan Academy and Coursera. Consolidating your strengths and actively working on your weaknesses are crucial to your personal development and success.</p>
                <p>In the pipeline, Hollo plans to scale internationally. But for the foreseeable future, Hollo plans to partner with more local and international practitioners and mindfulness programme directors to provide informative online courses
                  in multiple languages. </p>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Network</b></p>
                <p>Students often underestimate the sheer importance of networking. Some may even feel that they are not up to the challenge! Online platforms like LinkedIn have made the process easier, especially currently with stay-at-home orders. This is a great opportunity for you to update your LinkedIn profile to reflect your personal brand and the network you wish to attract. You can utilise virtual webinars, talks and career fairs to build and advance your network and come in contact with industry experts or professionals. Optimise your online presence to reflect your career aspirations. Find online communities that are of interest to you and become an active participant. When optimised, LinkedIn is a great platform to receive professional advice, build your network and get updates on upcoming webinars. It may also be easier for you to find work from your network, than the traditional application process.<p>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Conclusion </b></p>
              <p>With the new wave of infections, Hong Kong continues to reel from the effects of the pandemic. While fresh graduates struggle to find jobs, businesses struggle to keep afloat in these unprecedented times. As we always highlight in our articles, we encourage you, our readers, to look at the positive side and try to utilise this time to build something better for yourself. In our next article, our Start-Up Research Team shall share their insights following their interview with Besttop Consulting, who talk about how the pandemic affected their company and the tips they would like to give their future recruits or job-seekers in general. Stay tuned!</p>
