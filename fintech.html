              <p>“Digital authorised signatory management. The safe & simple way”</p>

Adoption is quick and easy, providing immediate benefit.

              <br>
              <p><h6>1. Funding Programs</h6></p>
              <br>
              <p>Fintech startups can apply for funding programs. Several government funding schemes are designated for startup companies. For example, HyperAir sourced a HK$100,000 subsidy from the Cyberport Creative Micro Fund. There are other funding programs in Hong Kong, such as Cyberport Accelerator Support Programme which provides up to HK$300,000 financial support to successful applicants.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><h6>2. Strategic and Financial Investors</h6></p>
              <br>
              <p>There are investors looking for strategic partnerships with fintech startups. They are willing to provide financial assistance to startups that can build hybrid solutions to solve problems in their industries. For example, Bowtie sourced funding of $234,000,000 from Sun Life Financial as a strategic and financial investor. On the other hand, WeLab was funded by $14,000,000 Series A capital from strategic and financial investors such as Sequoia Capital and TOM Group. Besides, the main investors of Cygnetise and Finhorizon are Calibrate Management and Deloitte Digital Disruptors respectively.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><h6>3. Self-financed Capitals</h6></p>
              <br>
              <p>Apart from external funding, fintech startup founders would usually make financial contributions to their own companies. For instance, HyperAir was established with self-financed capitals together with external funding, and MeReal Biometrics was funded by investment capital from its founder Patrick Partouche.
              </p>
              
                        <br>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>No one said it would be easy to work on a fintech startup. The growing diverse ecosystem of the fintech industry is certainly driving innovation to build a better world.
