                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Every start-up needs an original and revolutionary idea as its way through the industry competing with well-established firms. But what makes a start-up truly stand out is its sensitivity and agility towards the market atmosphere.
                  Here, we have one of our prime examples, a start-up in the education industry, BestTop.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BestTop Consulting Pte Ltd is a one-of-a-kind mentorship and educational institution, which started as a student group of 5-6 juniors. It was founded in Singapore in 2014 by two deeply motivated and determined individuals, Tony Jin
                  and Daniel Kang, hailing from the National University of Singapore (NUS). BestTop aims to provide professional customized career coaching services for students and working professionals worldwide. With hundreds of career mentors
                  from Fortune 500 companies, BestTop has direct access to rich industry insights and career development skills. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><u>Impact of COVID-19 </u></p>
                <p>COVID-19 has a considerable impact on not only BestTop but the job market in general. From mid-February to March, there was a decision lag amongst companies for laying off workers to deal with the situation. The gradual impact was
                  shown in April when companies started laying off people and reducing salaries. "Not only did they freeze the headcounts, but they also took precautions," said Tony. He also added, <b>"Job offers were delayed for months or denied
                    according to our students' feedback."</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Governments have been putting efforts into creating jobs for the locals. Similar to Hong Kong, the Singapore government launched stimulus packages to minimize damage to the job market. Apart from wage support for businesses, at the
                  end of January, the government imposed a work pass ban on new EP (Employment Pass) applicants from mainland China. Despite similar policies applied across the globe, Tony regarded the efforts to create and secure jobs for the locals
                  as understandable.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><u>BestTopâ€™s Response</u></p>
                <p>It is undeniable that the outbreak of COVID-19 has imposed a big challenge on BestTop. Nonetheless, they demonstrate remarkable adaptability in dealing with the circumstances.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>From Offline to Online</b></p>
                <p>BestTop used to have the Career Exploration Programs, co-organized with partnering institutions like HKU CEDARS. Every year, they will send one or two batches of students to Singapore to explore the Singapore career market through
                  company visits and structured training. They offer offline workshops and networking opportunities to broaden the career vision of students. With the current travel restrictions and quarantine regulations, BestTop had to put
                  everything on hold.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In response to the COVID crisis, BestTop started to provide online courses by launching BestTalent.
                  "We worked directly with the mentors to develop a suitable curriculum and liaised closely with our operations, marketing, and sales team." Tony explained that they did not have any prior experience in running online courses. By
                  adapting and learning quickly, they successfully attracted the first batch of students to join their program and received positive feedback.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="./images/bestTop2.jpg" class="articles-style" style="background-size: cover">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>From Short-term to Long-term</b></p>
                <p>The co-founders of BestTop have been conducting regular meetings to discuss company operations. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, they had a chance to slow down and reflect on the company's long-term strategies. "(Before the
                  outbreak of COVID-19) we didn't think too strategically on how much we want to achieve in the future." Tony recalled the times when he was packed with the operational issues of the company every day. In the past few months, he had
                  sufficient time to "recall, reflect, and foresee the future."</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tony now comes with a very clear goal regarding what he wants to do in 3 years, 5 years, and even 25 years. "I laid out a vision and mission for that part strategically," he added, "I also figured out a few programs that I could do
                  in the next one or two years." BestTop had an important lesson on strategic planning instead of focusing too much on short-term operations. It will confidently come with a much clearer vision after COVID-19.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="interview-subheadings"><b>Adapt and Take Opportunity</b></p>
                <p>As a start-up company, it is particularly important to be responsive and flexible. A high level of adaptability and agility could certainly help BestTop to come through the COVID-19 and the aftermath. It is also why Tony saw an
                  opportunity from the tough challenge.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During our conversation with Tony, we asked him what advice he would give to students who want to start their businesses, especially with COVID-19 looming over their heads. Tony shared with us his 3 part advice:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Adaptability
                    <br>
                    <p>Tony believes that there are many differences in what one anticipates how their start-up journey would be versus how it is. He said that founding a start-up is not easy, and the actual difficulty surrounding it is 10x more than
                      what one might estimate it to be. His reason for focusing heavily on adaptability was because the problems associated with running a start-up is mostly unforeseen. With that in mind, he stresses that all founders should be
                      willing to grow from these adverse times as it is a testament to being a successful founder.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>A Clear Purpose</li>
                  <br>
                  <p>Tony stressed heavily upon asking oneself - why are you doing this? A clear purpose keeps people going through times caused by COVID-19. He also shared with us how he took this time to figure out a growth plan for his company
                    instead of giving up. That was only possible because he knew his purpose clearly and was motivated to make his goal a reality.</p>
                  <li>Market Research</li>
                  <br>
                  <p>Tony explained to us why market research during the initial stages of a start-up is essential. Such research act like small experiments that provides a start-up with a clearer and defined sense of direction. These extra steps can enable a start-up to understand what aspects of its services or products it could prioritize. All in all, it will allow start-ups the flexibility to adapt its offerings in response to current situations. Besides, it ascertains market-fit with its customer</p>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We also asked him the important skills that students should develop this summer for future job-seeking activities. A recurring theme from most of Tony's answers was the importance of adaptability in the workspace. He mentioned that COVID-19 had also changed the way HRs recruit nowadays. He explained how many of them now prioritize 'adaptability' as one of the essential soft skills within candidates.<p>
                <br>
                    <p>Despite learning to be more adaptable, he said that students should focus heavily on understanding a company's mission and vision, as he believes those have changed and will change tremendously due to the pandemic. He advises all of us to reach out to more people to broaden our view and cultivate our network. For example, utilizing career summits and recruitment talks enables students to understand companies better. He also says that it is important to be active and ask people who you look up to for a coffee chat or a virtual chat so that you can get a more holistic view of the job market as well as the company while building meaningful connections.</p>
